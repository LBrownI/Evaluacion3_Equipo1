# GPU Inventory System 

Due to the complexity of the hardware specifications of the graphics cards and the large number of models available, the distributor faces the problem of "Inefficient Inventory Management". The diversity of specifications, such as clock speeds, memory capacities, and exclusive features, complicates the precise tracking and control of each graphics card in inventory. This has led to challenges in rapid product identification, effective specification updating and optimal distribution management, affecting operational efficiency and generating potential economic losses due to errors in inventory management.
